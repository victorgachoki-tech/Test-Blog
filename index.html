      Hello! The name's up there by the way ☝️. This is mainly a test website to try out
      domain access and website creation, although I might just make it my personal website
      in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe you can't tell, but I can't really build websites. So starting with something
      like a personal website was a good step to learn some shit. Cool cool cool, 
      toit toit toit toit, happy stalking! But for now, this is something really cool I've always
      wanted to try.
    </p>

    <p id="dynamicTextTest">I stole this from my brother's website</p>
    <script>
      const statements = [
        "Almost everything in this is stolen from my brother",
        "I don't give two shits",
        "It looks cool!"
      ];
      let index = 0;
      const paragraph = document.getElementById("dynamicTextTest");
      setInterval(() => {
        // Fade Out
        paragraph.classList.add("hidden");
        setTimeout(() => {
          // Update text and fade in
          index = (index + 1) % statements.length;
          paragraph.textContent = statements[index];
          paragraph.classList.remove("hidden")
        }, 500);
      }, 3000);
